@* GDPR: User profile page urls can include @usernames, which can be personal data.
So disable Google Analytics, so the url and username won't be sent to Google.
Also, tell Googlebot to not index these pages â€” maybe some people don't want
their usernames / names to be easily searchable.  [noindex_tag]
