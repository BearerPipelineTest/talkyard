# Googlebot needs to access these pages, to find the  [noindex_tag]
# <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> tag and understand that these pages are
# *not* to be indexed. However, relying on Disallow here in robots.txt (instead of
# a meta-noindex tag) doesn't work â€” Googlebot might index them *anyway* if they're
# linked to, from outside.
