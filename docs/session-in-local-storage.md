Short answer: Yes. If there's an XSS attack, you have other worse problems
anyway.

Nevertheless, planning to implement: `[weaksid]`.  x

Even more detils:

One risk is if someone logs in at a public computer, posts a
comment and then stays logged in (probably a Guest user?). However, I haven't seen
such public computers with a shared login account the last 10 years or so —
instead, on a shared computer in e.g. a library, everyone still logs in to
hens own Windows account; people don't use the same account and there's no
single shared web browser instance that othres can reuse after you. — So I
think this isn't that much of a problem (any longer), compared to the
inconvenience of people getting "randomly" logged out when they open
the same page in a different brower tab (`sessionStorage` doesn't work
accross different tabs in the same browser).  ...
... But now a few days ago, at a university, I noticed that apparently
the students keep reusing each other's Windows sessions, and possibly
browser session too.
